# SLAMTEC Aurora Remote SDK and Demo

([ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆç‚¹æ­¤](README.zh-CN.md))

![Aurora](res/aurora.device.png)


This repository contains the Demo code and project skeleton for using the SLAMTEC Aurora Remote SDK.


## Prerequisites
- SLAMTEC Aurora Device
- WiFi or Ethernet connection between the device and the host machine

## Prerequisites for Building
- CMake 3.12 or above
- C++14 Compiler (gcc 7.5 or above, MSVC 2019 or above, clang 8 or above)
- Pure C can be compiled with any C compiler that supports C11 (but C++ wrapper is not supported)
- OpenCV 4.2 or above (if you want to compile the demo that uses OpenCV)

## ROS Integration
- SLAMTEC provides Aurora ROS wrapper nodes for [ROS](https://github.com/Slamtec/aurora_ros) and [ROS2](https://github.com/Slamtec/aurora_ros/tree/ros2).
- You can find the wrapper nodes on SLAMTEC Aurora Website. ([ROS Wrapper Nodes](https://developer.slamtec.com/docs/slamware/aurora_ros2_sdk_en/))
- Some Aurora specific features are not supported in the ROS wrapper nodes, such as the auto floor detection.
- If you want to use the Aurora specific features, you need to use the Remote SDK.

## About the Remote SDK and SLAMWARE SDK
- The Remote SDK is a standalone library that can be used to retrieve data specific to SLAMTEC Aurora, such as point cloud, map, and odometry.
- The SLAMWARE SDK is a more general purpose library that can be used to control all SLAMTEC products, such as the SLAMKIT, SLAMWARE, Apollo Robot Platforms, A1/A2/A3 series, and also provides higher level APIs for tasks like mapping, localization, and navigation. 
- Currently, if you want to retrieve 3D point cloud data from SLAMTEC Aurora, you need to use the Remote SDK.
- For future SLAMWARE SDK releases, we will add APIs for Aurora in the SLAMWARE SDK.

## Have you tried the SLAMTEC Official Tool?
We are highly recommend you to use the SLAMTEC Official Tool first for better evaluation and development experience.

## API Reference of the Remote SDK
- [Remote SDK API Reference](doc/html/index.html)
This is the API reference for the Remote SDK. It contains the function prototypes, parameter descriptions, and return values for all the functions in the Remote SDK.


## Steps to build the Demos
1. Clone the repository and its submodules:
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Slamtec/aurora_remote_sdk_demo.git
   
2. (optional) Install the dependencies for the demo that uses OpenCV:
  
   e.g. on Ubuntu:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-dev
   ```

3. Build the demos with CMake.

    ```
    # navigate to source directory
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
4. Run the demo.


## How to deploy the SDK on target machines
- The precompiled libraries only depend on the C++ standard library, so it can be deployed on any machine that supports C++14.
- For Linux platforms, also make sure the glibc version is 2.31 or above.
